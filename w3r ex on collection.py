# Write a Python program that iterate over elements repeating each as many times as its count.
# from collections import Counter
# lis=Counter({3: 3, 5: 3, 1: 2, 2: 2, 7: 2, 4: 1, 6: 1, 8: 1})
# print(list(lis.elements()))



# Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts of a specified text
# a=input("Enter a string:\n")
# from collections import Counter
# print(Counter(a).most_common(3))




# create a deque and iterate over it
# from collections import deque
# a=deque('anshdholakia')
# for element in a:
#     print(element)




# Write a Python program that accept some words and count the number of distinct words.
# a=input("Enter a sentence:\n")
# lis=a.split(" ")
# from collections import Counter
# print(Counter(lis))




# Write a Python program to create a deque and append few elements to the left and right,
# then remove some elements from the left, right sides and reverse the deque.
# from collections import Counter
# import collections
# d=collections.deque(['ansh','dholakia'])
# d.appendleft('this is')
# print("After appending to the front:",d)
# d.append('YouTube Channel')
# print("After appending to the end:",d)



## **deque**: they are double ended queue that can be appended with and removed and are mostly used in stacks
